Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com).
Besides, it's good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Clone the repository:

<code>git clone https://github.com/TiagoAraujoDev/BeProductiveApp.git</code>

- Change to the repository folder, install the dependencies and run the script to run the application locally:

<code>cd FocusApp/</code>

<code>npm install</code>

<code>npm run dev</code>

<h3 id="objetivo">🎯 Goals</h3>

- In this project I was practing ReactJS building a modern and usefull application.
- To follow the market needs I was using Typescript in this app and others before this one, because the typing is a good feature to development.
- The most import technologies used in this app was vite to create a good development enviroment and some important libraries such as react-hook-form to manage forms, zod to help with typing, immer to work with immutability in a easy way, styled-components to give styles to the app and react-router-dom to create routes.
- A clean code was my main goal here. No design patterns just a readable code.
